I am a post-doctoral researcher in Computational Social Science at the Institute of Public Administration, [Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, Leiden University, the Netherlands](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/governance-and-global-affairs). I hold a [DPhil (PhD) in Politics from the University of Oxford, UK](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/), and prior to that, I completed an MA (1st) in Political Science and a BA (2:1) in Government at the [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/).

From an earlier focus on cabinets and civil service, I have developed an active research agenda on how emerging technologies –including AI– shape policymaking and the organisation of bureaucracies. My work has appeared in *Social Science Computer Review*, *World Development*, *Government and Opposition*, *The International Journal of Press/Politics*, *The British Journal of Politics and International Relations* and elsewhere.

During my current postdoctoral appointment, I am mainly contributing to an NWO-funded project on automated text analysis of investment data, investigating how governance structures shape sustainable investments. Specifically, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text-as-data methods to identify patterns and topics within large-scale textual corpora. In addition, I teach the Institutions of Governance and Development course at Leiden University College.

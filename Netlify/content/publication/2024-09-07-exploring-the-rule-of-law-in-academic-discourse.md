abstract: 'The rule of law is a foundational concept of state governance, admired for its ideals but also subject to significant controversy, particularly concerning its precise definition. Given the complexity of this evolving field, both in theory and practice, our article systematically analyzes the existing academic literature on the rule of law, focusing on two primary objectives. Firstly, it seeks to elucidate the intellectual structure of the rule of law field by identifying, among others, key sources, references and influential authors. Secondly, it aims to delineate the thematic focus within the rule of law literature. To accomplish these objectives, the article employs a bibliometric analysis that includes topic modeling and network analysis techniques. This article serves as an invaluable resource for those who are new to the field of the rule of law, providing a concise and comprehensive overview of its complex landscape.'

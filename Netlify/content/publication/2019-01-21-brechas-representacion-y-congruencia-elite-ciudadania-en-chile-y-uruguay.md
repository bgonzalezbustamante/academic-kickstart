abstract: 'This paper analyses three dimensions of elite-mass congruence in Chile and  Uruguay:  (a)  ideological;  (b)  public issues,  support, and satisfaction with democracy; and, (c) economic preferences on the role of the State. Data from probabilistic national surveys and surveys on elites financed by IDRC-Canada and carried out from  2013  to  2014  in each country are used.  Congruence indexes are calculated to identify gaps between citizens and representatives. The main indexes used are Relative Citizen Congruence and Earth Mover’s Distance, a recent innovation borrowed from computer science. The findings show a greater ideological congruence in Chile, a greater congruence on support to democracy in  Uruguay, and important gaps on education issues in  Chile.  Furthermore,  in both countries, there is greater congruence regarding relevant public issues between higher socioeconomic level population and the political elite.'
